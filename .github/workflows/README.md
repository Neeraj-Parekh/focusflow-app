### Post-Workflow Setup

After running the workflow, additional manual configuration is required:

#### Environment Variables
Set up the following environment variables:
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/focusflow
REDIS_URL=redis://host:6379

# AI Services
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Security
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_encryption_key

# External Services
SMTP_HOST=your_smtp_host
SMTP_USER=your_smtp_user
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_smtp_password
```

#### Deployment Steps
1. Configure DNS and SSL certificates
2. Set up database and run migrations
3. Deploy containers to chosen environment
4. Initialize AI models and training data
5. Configure monitoring and alerting
