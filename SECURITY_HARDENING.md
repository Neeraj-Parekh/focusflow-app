- QR code generation for authenticator apps
- Backup codes for account recovery
- SMS and email MFA (extensible framework)

#### 3. Advanced Rate Limiting
- Multi-tier adaptive rate limiting
- IP, user, and user-agent based tracking
- ML-based anomaly detection
- Configurable thresholds per endpoint

#### 4. Enhanced Password Security
- Advanced password strength validation
- Entropy calculation and crack time estimation
- Personal information detection
- Adaptive bcrypt cost factor optimization

#### 5. Secure Token Management
- JWT with enhanced claims (jti, nbf, iat)
- Token revocation capability via Redis
- Secure token generation and validation
- Refresh token support

#### 6. Data Protection
- AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
- PBKDF2 key derivation
- Secure data masking for logs
- Cryptographic primitives using industry standards

#### 7. Security Monitoring
- Real-time security event logging
- Threat pattern detection
- Security dashboard with metrics
- Automated alerting for high-risk events

## Security Thresholds and Configuration

### Rate Limits
- Login attempts: 5 per 5 minutes
- API calls: 1000 per hour
- AI requests: 100 per hour
- Password resets: 3 per hour
- MFA attempts: 10 per 5 minutes

### Threat Detection
- Risk scores: 0.0 (safe) to 1.0 (critical)
- Critical threshold: ≥0.8 (blocks access)
- High threshold: ≥0.6 (requires MFA)
- Medium threshold: ≥0.3 (logs warning)

### Password Requirements
- Minimum length: 12 characters (upgraded from 8)
- Character complexity: uppercase, lowercase, digits, special chars
- Personal information detection
- Common password blocking
- Entropy validation (minimum 50 bits)

## Implementation Files

### Updated Files
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Updated with secure dependency versions
- `.gitignore` - Added security scan reports and virtual environment exclusions

### New Files
- `backend/app/core/advanced_security.py` - Advanced security manager implementation
- `execute_security_patches.sh` - Automated security patch deployment script
- `test_security.py` - Security module testing framework
- `SECURITY_HARDENING.md` - This documentation

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Execute Security Patches
```bash
./execute_security_patches.sh
```

### 2. Update Environment Configuration
Add to your `.env` file:
```env
# Enhanced Security Settings
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
SECRET_KEY=your-production-secret-key-min-32-chars
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-fernet-encryption-key-44-chars
```

### 3. Initialize Advanced Security
```python
from app.core.advanced_security import AdvancedSecurityManager

# Initialize with Redis and secret key
security_manager = AdvancedSecurityManager(
    redis_url=settings.REDIS_URL,
    secret_key=settings.SECRET_KEY
)
```

### 4. Enable Security Features
- Configure rate limiting middleware
- Set up MFA for admin accounts
- Enable threat detection monitoring
- Configure security event alerting

## Testing and Validation

### Run Security Tests
```bash
python3 test_security.py
```

### Verify Vulnerability Patches
```bash
# After running execute_security_patches.sh
cat backend/security_report.json
cat backend/bandit_report.json
```

### Security Monitoring
Access security dashboard data:
```python
dashboard_data = await security_manager.get_security_dashboard_data()
```

## Compatibility

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility with the existing `SecurityManager` class. All existing authentication and security functions continue to work without modification.

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. Implement hardware security key support
2. Add geolocation-based threat detection
3. Integrate with SIEM systems
4. Implement zero-trust architecture
5. Add advanced ML threat models

## Security Compliance

This implementation addresses:
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) standards
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework guidelines
- Industry best practices for authentication and authorization

## Support and Maintenance

- Regular dependency updates
- Continuous vulnerability monitoring
- Security event log analysis
- Threat pattern updates
