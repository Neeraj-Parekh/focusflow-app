## Testing on Android

For detailed instructions on installing and testing on Android devices, see:
[Android Installation Guide](ANDROID_INSTALL.md)

## Testing Locally

You can test the app locally using a simple HTTP server:

```bash
cd WebApp
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

For proper testing of PWA features (including service worker), use a tool like:

```bash
npx serve
```

## Mobile Testing Considerations

When testing on mobile:
1. Some browsers restrict autoplay of audio until user interaction
2. Allow notifications when prompted for timer completion alerts
3. Test the offline functionality by enabling airplane mode after loading the app
